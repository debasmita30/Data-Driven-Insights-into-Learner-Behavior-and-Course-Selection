# Data-Driven-Insights-into-Learner-Behavior-and-Course-Selection


## Overview  
This project examines student engagement across EdTech platforms and course streams using R and Power BI to extract insights and guide strategy.

## Objective  
- Identify which course streams attract most students  
- Analyze platform-wise engagement behavior  
- Derive student personas (age, preferred platform, engagement)  
- Locate optimization opportunities in underperforming streams  

## Tech Stack  
- **R**: Data processing & exploratory analysis  
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard  
- **CSV**: Processed hierarchy + engagement dataset  

## R Analysis  
**Script:** `student_engagement_analysis.R`  
- Cleaned and aggregated the dataset  
- Computed top 10 streams by course count and engagement  
- Derived platform engagement & personas  
- Visualized platform engagement via `ggplot2`

## Key Insights  
- Platform-wise average engagement and student counts  
- Top-performing streams segmented by engagement  
- Dominant student personas for best-performing streams  
- Streams with lowest engagement identified for improvement
